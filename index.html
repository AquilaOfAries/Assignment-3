                        						<p>The results of my personal PANAS test, are: Positive affect: 30 Negative affect: 27 The PANAS test, or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, measures, as the extended name suggests, the susceptibility of positive and negative affect toward personality traits, i.e., moods and emotions. More specifically regarding the scale, ‘positive affect’ refers to the individual’s tendency to experience positive emotions, a more positive manner of interaction and engagement with others and with personal obstacles and challenges. On the other hand, ‘negative affect’ scales traits of a more negative or unpleasurable nature, perspectives of negative inclination towards things such as connections and surroundings. For each dimension of the PANAS scale, both positive and negative, the resulting score falls between 10 and 50. The scale of score indicates one’s general susceptibility of negative and positive affect, whereby in terms of positive affect, a score of <25 is considered low positive affect, 26-35 is moderate and >36 is high. As for negative affect, a score of <10 is considered low negative affect, 11-20 moderate, and >21 is high.</p>
