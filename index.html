                        						<p>The results of my personal PANAS test, are: Positive affect: 30 Negative affect: 27 The PANAS test, or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, measures, as the extended name suggests, the susceptibility of positive and negative affect toward personality traits, i.e., moods and emotions. More specifically regarding the scale, ‘positive affect’ refers to the individual’s tendency to experience positive emotions, a more positive manner of interaction and engagement with others and with personal obstacles and challenges. On the other hand, ‘negative affect’ scales traits of a more negative or unpleasurable nature, perspectives of negative inclination towards things such as connections and surroundings. For each dimension of the PANAS scale, both positive and negative, the resulting score falls between 10 and 50. The scale of score indicates one’s general susceptibility of negative and positive affect, whereby in terms of positive affect, a score of <25 is considered low positive affect, 26-35 is moderate and >36 is high. As for negative affect, a score of <10 is considered low negative affect, 11-20 moderate, and >21 is high.</p>

                            <h2> Group Processes: </h2>
                              <article> The Beginners worked cohesively as a team for assignment 2. Each member was punctual when Teams meetings were scheduled, delegation of responsibility was equal throughout the 5 members, and each brought unique strengths and contribution to the assignment. However, there were items which were identified for improvement in A3, as summarised below:  </article>
                              <ul>
                                <li> Minutes were not effectively captured during MS Teams meetings. Upon reflection of a comment or delegation of work within our Teams meetings, it was difficult to access concise information without watching the recording again. This will be improved for A3 through established templates and assignment of minute taking responsibility.  </li>
                                <li> Individual files added to Teams were not effectively labelled, therefore when reverting to a section for collaborative work or consolidation into the master document, identifying the correct file was difficult. Standardised nomenclature for file names was established for A3.  </li>
                                <li> The initial breakdown of tasks was performed in a way that caused an entire section to be missed. Essentially, each A2 section was identified, and a discussion regarding responsibility and approach would stem from that initial section in Teams chat. However, with section chats and new chat topics developing, the Industry Data section became buried as discussions progressed. The Beginners team assumed all requirements were covered without vigilantly aligning the rubric or assignment summary with our report. The method of identifying requirements and responsibilities is revised for A3.  </li>

                              </ul>

                    <h2> Career Plans: </h2>
                      <h3> Valentin Parail – IT Manager </h3>
                          <p> Valentin maintains his enthusiasm toward a career as an IT manager. Currently, his focus is firmly on achieving solid results in his Bachelor of IT studies to complement experience gained in his occupation as Applications Support Analyst. With a passion from an early age for all things IT, the technical path comes naturally to Val, however, formal qualifications are important for the IT manager role, particularly within such an evolving industry. For this reason, Val intends to continue developing a repertoire of certifications and associated technical skills whilst further developing management and soft skills. Val intends to pursue a master’s degree after current undergraduate completion.   </p>
                      <h3> Chris Anderson – Visual Simulator Database Developer </h3>
                          <p> Chris’ ambition toward a career as Visual Simulator Database Developer remains unchanged. Chris’ current role is working for a company that is associated with the aerospace industry, where he is gaining real-world experience with pilot training simulation, an area he intends to pursue. Software development and engineering is a core function of the role and therefore, beyond an undergraduate qualification, Chris intends to further his expertise by undertaking postgraduate research related to software development, ideally, aligned and supported through his current employer.  </p>
                      <h3> Andrew McKenna – Digital Forensics Senior Consultant  </h3>
                          <p> Andrew’s passion to pursue a career in digital forensics is unchanged. Andrew is already aligning this ambition by previously completing a bachelor’s degree in criminology, majoring in criminal behaviour. His current studies toward a bachelor of IT are the next stage to establish prerequisite technical skills related to the field. Beyond completion of this second degree, Andrew intends on focusing further knowledge growth in computer engineering and cyber security. The role of Digital Forensics Senior Consultant is independent and practical application is paramount. Formal qualifications and certification are beneficial and a good method to obtaining knowledge, so Andrew is an eager student of lifelong learning.  </p>
                      <h3> Oliver Sloane – Cyber Security Analyst  </h3>
                          <p> Oliver remains interested in a career within cyber security. As this can be a broad role that is applied to many technical areas, he hopes that during his bachelor of IT studies he can identify a specific area for him to pursue beyond graduation. He has a genuine passion for all things IT, particularly programming, so he intends to undertake further courses to build this expertise. New and emerging trends have always an interest to Oliver and critically evaluating emerging technology is a key area for a cyber security analyst. He is also passionate about sharing his knowledge, another key responsibility of the role.  </p>
                      <h3> Marc Winbank – Operations Director, Mining Technologies   </h3>
                          <p> Marc has decided to change his ideal job from assignment 2, the only member in team Beginners to do so. The reason for the decision is to better align with his current skillset and ambitions. Currently, Marc works with a global team to implement and manage geophysical instruments and services for clients on their mining project. Marc has previous experience in geology studies; however, his current bachelor is business, majoring in supply chain. He understands that technical qualifications are highly beneficial to his career goals, therefore beyond the current Introduction to IT subject, he has decided to pursue further education in programming and hardware schematics once graduated.   </p>
                      <h3>Comparative career summary: </h3>
                          <img src="table for careers.png" alt="Table of Careers">

                            <p>Table 1 above summarises respective requirements of team Beginner members’ career goals. This graphic can be used to identify common elements and skillsets of each position. The positions are quite diverse, with team management responsibilities shared amongst IT manager, digital forensics senior consultant and operations director roles. For this requirement, soft and business skillsets are critical for success, often developed through long-term experience in the same or similar roles. Soft skills are also quite important for both the visual simulator database developer and cyber security analyst, the main difference being who they will communicate with, as these roles will require close collaboration with internal team members rather than that of customer or client relationships. </p>
                            <p> In terms of career plans across the group, all would benefit with postgraduate studies, and all will require continual technical development to evolve alongside a dynamic industry. The digital forensics senior consultant and cyber security analyst will need to continually update their practical knowledge of emerging technologies, as early in the adoption period these will often experience new methods of manipulation and exploitation. The outlier in terms of IT-heavy experience is that of the operations director in mining technologies, however, IT knowledge would be held in high regard for the integration of datasets and troubleshooting in remote mining locations. Business skillsets are quite important for the managerial positions, so further formal education and certification along with practical experience will bolster opportunities within executive-level growth.  </p>

                <h2> Tools: </h2>
                    <p> For this assignment we had used a compilation of different tools. With the basics such as Github for the creation of the website, Microsoft Teams for the main source of communication. Then for the advanced side of the assignment for creating the project idea, we had used software like Proto.io, and Beeware. With using coding languages HTML and python. </p>

                <h2>Project Description: </h2>
                  <h3> Overview:  </h3>
                      <p> We propose to create an application that will estimate the user's risk of crime, either as an individual or as a business. This application will take the form of a questionnaire, which will ask the user increasingly specific questions and return increasingly accurate assessments of risk. What we really hope to accomplish through this app is to give individuals and businesses a better understanding of their risk of being a victim of a crime, and what crimes they are subject to. We believe that with an informed understanding, people can make better decisions about what level of risk exposure they are comfortable with, and at what point they should take extra steps to reduce that risk. The scope of our project is such that, with continued development, we intend to provide users with customised tips based on criminological theory and their own input about how they can mitigate their risk.    </p>

                      <p> Our application will not be a silver bullet to forever eliminate the fear of crime, we simply aim to give people an improved understanding of their own risk and the steps they can take to reduce it. The outcomes we are aiming for are focused on increasing knowledge and awareness of risk of crime, and thus better equipping them with the knowledge of what they should focus their risk reduction efforts on and how they can reduce risk. In addition, by utilizing real statistics, we are aiming to help increase confidence for businesses to open in areas that are popularly seen as being dangerous, but with no higher risk than anywhere else. We think that this program could make it more accessible for businesses to open in the neighborhoods that would genuinely benefit from investment, without the fear of crime as a barrier. Finally, when we reach the stage that we can collect our own reliable data on crime rates and demographics, we hope to be a resource for crime prevention efforts on a larger scale, by working with local, state, and federal governments. </p>

                      <p> Our motivation to create this program comes from our interest in crime, not just within our group, but as a society at large. Crime is an enormous part of our collective consciousness, it is all over the news every day, in our movies, books, tv shows, podcasts, and in our music. This saturation with crime means that it is always on people's minds. We think, and it has been well documented, that crime is not as serious a problem as it has become in our public consciousness (Callanan, 2005) (Lee and Mythen, 2017). We want to help people understand their risk based on statistics and data, not on the perception they get from the news and social media. This application is interesting to use because it is a simple premise that could profoundly change the way society thinks about their relationship to crime. This program may be a working example to a future employer that we have been effective working as a team, be able to set a solid structure for what we want to accomplish, and that we are passionate about using technology to help people better understand their surroundings.   </p>

                      <p> There are similar programs and web apps that have been operating for some time. Websites such as NeighbourhoodScout.com and PerthCrimeMap.com both show statistics for crimes over a map view based on suburb. Government bodies like the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) and Crime Statistics Agency in Victoria both keep detailed statistics on the rate, type, and location of crime. What our proposed application will do differently is make the data more specific than the website crime maps, and more accessible than the government agencies. The interactive questionnaire nature of our app, where the user decides whether to progress to the next question or exit the program, means that our application can be as general or as specific as the user wants it to be. There are also a host of public resources available to help people reduce their risk of crime, some of these are also based on criminological statistics. However, in our reading, none are customised to the reader or user, and none are packaged with a risk assessment tool. Our application would therefore be the first on the market to bridge the gap between the general assessments of crime map websites, the near inaccessibility of government statistics, and the general advice of online government and insurance advice on reducing risk. Further, our intention to create the program as an application means that it will be the first of its kind available outside of a web browser on a phone. Finally, while there are proposals to use machine learning to predict crime, this functionality is restricted to use in policing, and is focused on tracking hotspots, rather than being used to predict the likelihood of crime victimization for a person (Shah, Bhagat and Shah, 2021) (Kshatri et al., 2021).    </p>

                  <h3>Aims</h3>
                    <h5> “Develop a questionnaire program to determine the user’s risk of crime”  </h5>
                      <p> Our aim is to calculate the user’s actual risk of being a victim of a crime. Through developing a quiz to ask the user questions and using those responses we aim to calculate the actual risk as a percentage of the user being a victim of a crime. The choice to program our application in the form of a questionnaire is intended to make it more accessible to the widest variety of users. We will accomplish this using crime statistics stored as variables. Our program will calculate the risk based on data such as: the demographic they are in, the suburb they live in, whether they have been a victim of a crime recently, etc. We believe this will reduce crime through education as our quiz will provide information on strategies to avoid the crimes that the program determines they are most at risk of. We also hope that with a better understanding of their actual risk, people can make more informed decisions about their risk.  </p>
                      <p> “Create a database of crime information”   </p>
                      <p>These crimes may include:
                        <ul>
                          <li> Child Protection </li>
                          <li> Counterfeit Currency</li>
                          <li> Cyber Crime </li>
                          <li> Drug Crime </li>
                          <li> Environmental Crime </li>
                          <li> Family Law </li>
                          <li> Terrorism </li>
                          <li> Fraud </li>
                          <li> Human Trafficking </li>

                        </ul>

                    <img src="app title.png" alt="App Title." style="width:300px;height:400px;">

                        <p> Proceeds of Crime (AFP (Australian Federal Police), 2021)   </p>
                        <p> As we can see from the above list, there are still many sub-categories to explore, and this is not something researched or expected that a reasonable person would do. We will use crime statistics to fill out most of this data and the answers people provide in the quiz will correlate on this information.  </p>
                        <p> The source of the data is also crucial. Data that relies only on crimes that people have been convicted for, or only on crimes that have been reported to the police will be subject to the phenomenon of unreported crime. This means that, given that most of the crime that occurs is not reported to the police (Crime Victimisation, Australia, 2019-20 financial year, 2021), all data needs to be based on victim surveys. As the crime statistics collected by the ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) are based on victim surveys, this data will be used to populate the database (Crime Victimisation, Australia methodology, 2019-20 financial year, 2021).    </p>
                    <h5> “Create a database of questions and answers”  </h5>
                        <p>  Databases are used to store application information for use and a database management system such as oracle will be used to control storage, deletion, retrieval, and security of our data. A data store is essential as the quiz will not function without data (Ambysoft, 2021).  Questions will be based on the factors that crime statistics collect, and later in the development of the program we intend to collect and use our own statistics so that we can be more specific with our risk reduction advice. We intend to structure the questionnaire to give the user their risk score after each question, with the ability to finish answering questions at any point. This will ensure that the program is as detailed or as specific as the user requires.    </p>
                    <h5> “Code the quiz to be user friendly”   </h5>
                        <p> In this step we want the user interface to enable users to easily fill out and receive results from our quiz. This stage will be achieved through testing, which is important as people will not use the quiz if it is confusing or uncooperative. We intend to release this program as an app on both Android and IOS, as we believe that this approach will make the app most widely available. The coding for the backend will be done in Python, with the user interface being constructed with proto.io, and the database hosted with AWS. Python is a general use programming language which two members of our team are familiar with, further, its integration with proto.io makes it well suited to this program. We have chosen proto.io for the creation of the user interface because of its synergy with the Python programming language and its ability to deploy using native elements on both Android and IOS devices (Keith-Magee, 2021). Finally, we have chosen AWS to host the database chiefly because of its cheap cost compared to hosting on other cloud services such as Oracle.    </p>
                    <h5> “Create a Machine Learning Algorithm to Predict Crime”  </h5>
                        <p> This goal is to create a machine learning algorithm that we will train using the data we propose to collect through our own victim surveys. We intend to use a linear regression model to train this algorithm as this has been used in a comparable way to predict crime described in Crime Forecasting: A Machine Learning and Computer Vision Approach, using linear regression we will be able to predict the likelihood of victimisation by comparing the user's inputs to our database (Shah, Bhagat and Shah, 2021). We will measure the accuracy of this algorithm by using a confusion matrix, obviously aiming for as high an accuracy as we can get. We also intend to display the accuracy to the user when displaying their risk score.    </p>
                    <h5> “Create the sign-in feature”   </h5>
                        <p> This goal is to build an option for users to create an account to save their answers. We think this is a necessary feature as it will make using the app much more accessible if the user does not have to go through the entire process of completing the survey in its entirety every time, they want a risk assessment. We think this feature will also be helpful in allowing the user to view their updated score as we improve the accuracy of our machine learning feature or add new data with further victim surveys. </p>

                    <h2> Plans </h2>
                        <p> We are aiming to create an application that will run on both Android and IOS. This application is intended to take the form of a questionnaire. This questionnaire will have two tracks, one that will ask the user questions about their personal circumstances and the other that will ask questions about the circumstances of their household or business. Based on the users answers to these questions the program will put the user in a category and calculate their risk of crime. This calculation will initially be based on crime statistics collected by government agencies like the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Crime Statistics Agency of Victoria and stored in a database that we will create and maintain. When we have seen sufficient uptake in the use of our program, we intend to run our own victim surveys to collect our own data.    </p>

                    <h3> Collection of Data:  </h3>
                        <p> As mentioned in the plans for the project section above, we initially intend to build our database using the statistics collected by the ABS and the CSA (Child Support Agency) in Victoria. We have chosen these government bodies because of the methodology of their data collection. One of the earliest concepts that criminology students are taught is the problem of relying on statistics that come from the police or from courts. Both sources are subject to a host of factors that degrade the reliability of their data, the most significant of these is the phenomenon of unreported crime. The article Neighborhood Characteristics and the Reporting of Crime asserts that the amount of crime reported to the police is only about one third (Goudriaan, Wittebrood and Nieuwbeerta, 2005). Of the crimes that is reported to the police, these statistics can also be unreliable. Eterno, Verma, and Silverman describe how police can manipulate statistics collection usually due to pressure from management to keep consistently reducing the numbers (Eterno, Verma and Silverman, 2014). For these reasons we are building the database for our program with only statistics collected through victim surveys, and with a statistically significant sample size. The use of victim surveys means that we can avoid the problems affecting the collection of data that police and court statistics are subject to.    </p>
                        <p> As part of the scope of our program, we intend to collect our own data by conducting our own victim survey as part of the program. We intend to offer users of our program the choice of improving our data and the recommendations that our application can offer. One of the major problems identified with the National Crime Victimization Survey conducted by the US Bureau of Justice is its lack of privacy, which means that incidences of rape and sexual assault remain underreported (House, Kalsbeek and Kruttschnitt, 2014). To ensure that we get the maximum response to our survey and the best data, we intend to run the survey with as much of a focus on privacy and user anonymity as possible when questions about demographic and location data is requested. We hope that these measures ensure that respondents feel comfortable answering.    </p>

                 <h2> Iterations </h2>
                    <h3> First Iteration </h3>
                        <p> Our first iteration of a plan for this program was vague. The initial idea was for the program to be programmed entirely in Python and run in the Python shell without a proper user interface but still taking the form of a questionnaire, however, due to feedback from A2, we noted that a shift away from this method was required. In the initial idea for the program, the risks assessments that the user would see would be stored as variables in Python, not in a database. The initial intent for the program was not so much to help reduce crime, but more to allow the user to make sense of the crime statistics available from the ABS. The intent was also to make the general, vague statistics that the user can look at on the ABS website and make them more applicable to the average user. From this iteration we kept the general idea of the program, we still intend for it to be a questionnaire, be programmed in Python, and make use of ABS statistics.    </p>
                    <h3> Second Iteration:   </h3>
                        <p> The second iteration of our program updated our program to include a SQL database to store our statistics and to be able to provide the user with links to crime prevention resources and information on criminological theory. We drew upon Chris’s experience in the creation of databases to help us design a skeleton for a questionnaire that would add percentage points to the user's risk score based on their answers to ten questions. Finally, we decided to create a user interface for our program using Tkinter, which would allow us to make the program more accessible to users who are unable to run it in the Python shell, update our SQL database, and make the program look and feel a lot more professional.   </p>
                    <h3> Third and Current Iteration:   </h3>
                        <p> The third and current iteration of our project is our most comprehensive. We have moved away from the plan to run our program on a laptop or desktop operating system using Tkinter and now plan to design the program as an application using proto.io, which will allow us to ship it as an application that will run on both IOS and Android devices. Proto.io is a suite of open-source software that will allow us to design our application, write it once, and deploy it on both systems. The shift toward a mobile application was taken to make the app more user friendly and accessible, platforms like the Play Store and the App Store on apple devices can be used to gain the widest possible reach into the market.  </p>
                        <p>  An additional update to our plan focuses on the aim of our project. While initially we intended for the program to be a way of making crime statistics more accessible and relevant to users, we are now aiming to really make a difference in the lives of users. We want to help them better understand their risk and to be able to provide actionable advice on how they can make themselves, their families, and their businesses safer. While this difference may seem unimportant, it will subtly change the way our program takes shape. The chief difference that our change of goals will make is associated with the longer-term ambitions of our program. Once we can begin collecting our own data, we intend to give users much more specific advice on how to reduce risk. Our more specific questions and advice are intended to be informed by policing and crime reduction theory such as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), the risks of repeat victimization, and advice for users that are experiencing intimate partner or family violence. We believe that this crime prevention advice can be a decisive factor to prevent future victimization and believe that it is worth the extra effort to program.  </p>
                        <p> We have also elected to add in a feature that we found interesting in other programs that are available, a way for users to instantly search by their postcode or local government area and find the three most common crimes specific to that area. We also intend for this breakdown to further include the location of those crimes, and the most common victims. For example, if a user wants to look up the suburb of Armadale, the information the program would show is displayed as:
                            <ol>
                              <li> Stealing – most common during daylight hours, most common targets: mobile phones  </li>
                              <li> Drug offences – most common during evening hours, most common target: N/A   </li>
                              <li> Property Damage – most common during night hours, most common target: fast food restaurants   </li>

                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p> We believe that this feature would enable users to quickly gain insight into the type of neighbourhood they may reside in, or are considering a relocation to, and to provide information regarding specifics to be aware of.  We also intend to add to our program the ability for users to sign in and save their data inputs. Maintaining our aim of giving control of the accuracy of the program to the user, we do not intend to make this feature mandatory. This feature is intended to facilitate gathering of updated risk assessments easier for users as we update our database and develop our machine learning algorithm (mentioned in the next paragraph) to be more accurate.    </p>
                        <p> The final feature we have decided to add to our program is also the most ambitious. We intend to add a machine learning algorithm to our program and train it to identify predictors of crime. We think this feature will really help us work toward our aim of reducing victimization, because unlike our earlier plan to relay statistics from past victim surveys to the user, the machine learning ability of the program will be able to make predictions regarding how likely the user is to experience crime in the future, based on their current answers. We are planning to use linear regression algorithms, similarly to what is currently being proposed by authors such as Shah, Bhagat, and Shah in their article Crime Forecasting: a Machine Learning and Computer Vision Approach. While these authors present a case for the utility of using machine learning to predict crimes to help police make more efficient use of limited resources, we propose using it to help the average person take steps to reduce their risk of crime (Shah, Bhagat and Shah, 2021). We will be testing the accuracy of our machine learning algorithm using a confusion matrix. This will allow us to be certain that the algorithm is predicting crimes.  </p>

                <h2> Our Progress </h2>
                  <p> To date, the features of the program are in the prototyping phase. We have created a prototype user interface in Proto.io, have a diagram for how the SQL database is to be created, have a diagram for the path of how the program will run, and we are currently working on the Python back-end code. The user interface is currently a work in progress, and we have chosen a dark background with lighter colored text for the app to stand out and be easier on the eyes. We believe
                this will help users operate the app and also make the app stand out more when people glance over other people’s shoulders. The text in the app is targeted at users of all ages and we believe navigating the app will be easy as we have a home button on the bottom of every page. While this is not the final design it appears we are onto something that the team agrees will take us forward into the final development of the user interface.  </p>

                  <h5> Creation of the User Interface  </h5>
                    <p> We will create a prototype user interface using the web app Proto.io. This will allow us to make sure we design the app to be user friendly from the start and give the group a clearer picture of what the app will look like when we create it with Beeware. </p>
                    <p> As we intend for the program to be an app, and capable of running on IOS and Android, the user interface will be programmed with Beeware. Beeware is an open-source collection of tools that will allow our team to design a user interface that interacts with the native formatting of the platform that the user is running. </p>
                  <h5> Hosting the Database  </h5>
                    <p> We intend to host the database using a cloud service like Amazon Web Services or Oracle. Hosting on a cloud service will allow the user to run the program as long as they have a connection to the internet and a device capable of running the app. Hosting on a cloud service, as opposed to making the data part of the installation package will keep the app lightweight and accessible. </p>

                      <li> We can test the user interface with test users to determine whether the questions are worded optimally, and the program has satisfied our goal of being user friendly.  </li>
                      <li> We intend to add in the option for users to leave feedback into how we can improve the app. </li>
                      <li> We could release a timed beta version, concluding with a victim survey for the users participating in the beta. Ideally this would include a significant sample of the population. For us to be confident in our programs ability to predict the likelihood of the user being a victim of a crime, the victim survey would need to be close to the statistics that we based the database on. This survey component could be a problem as the lockdowns around the country due to COVID-19 would have significant impacts on the data and whether it can be applied to future years that will (hopefully) be lockdown free.  </li>
                      <li> We are intending to test the machine learning algorithm part of the program using a confusion matrix to determine how accurate its predictions are. The confusion matrix will allow us to test whether the machine learning algorithm is predicting the probability of crimes. </li>

                <h2> Risks:  </h2>
                  <p> One of the biggest risks to the development of our project is the software we are depending on using to create the user interface, Beeware. As none of our team have any experience with this tool, or with any user interface design, we are relying on our ability to pick it up quickly and to a high standard. </p>
                  <p> Another risk to our development is the ability of our team to test the program. We have a limited amount of time to build a working copy of our program and to test it. The nature of our project as more of a long-term investment is also something that we will not be able to know if it is achieving its aim of reducing victimization for some time. </p>
                  <p> Another risk to the long-term success of our program is the quality of data required. To fully achieve our aim the program needs to be regularly updated with the latest data, and with a high enough sample size that the collected data is statistically reliable. At the stage where we are collecting our own data, either using opt-in surveys at the end of the program or as fully-fledged victim surveys, we can ensure that our data is reliable. Prior to that stage we will need to rely on the statistics collected by government agencies, which may not be as specific as we would like them to be. </p>

                <h2> Group processes and communications:  </h2>
                <p> Given our success using Microsoft Teams during Assignment 2, we have elected to continue using that for our communication and for holding meetings. Meetings are conducted face to face using the meetings feature provided by Microsoft Teams. Our team aims to meet once to twice a week, with more meetings in the weeks that submissions are due. We are recording each meeting to accommodate members who may not be available to catch up and continue to make meaningful contributions to the group work. Meeting minutes are also taken as a convenient summary of each meeting and to document tasks assigned and the member responsible.   </p>
                <p> For this assessment, we have decided to use GitHub earlier and more extensively. Both to store the files for our website and the python files that make up our program.    </p>

                <h2> Skills and Jobs:  </h2>
                  <p> When bringing this program to adventure capitalists I believe the right team for this will be able to make a future of this project, taking it to the next level of development, with the foundation of this program already built. Implementing these key positions will bring a more professional standpoint, bringing innovating thinking to the equation, allowing growth for all areas in the project.  </p>
                  <p> For this program to take off for appropriate client tell. The 4 key positions required are:  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li> Lead developer: A lead developer would need a strong understanding of crime statistics and criminological theory with a history of programming as well, to provide the quality detail to this project and provide the bulk of the information for development. The lead developer would need to communicate well with his colleagues to be able to delegate tasks effectively and clearly. Set out guidelines that need to be met, for each section of the project to allow for collaboration between each part and keep track of progression.  </li>
                      <li> Database Manager: A database manager is required to have a foundational knowledge of RDBMS (relational database management system), such as oracle storage data. They would be required to collate the projects data into tables that the database will accept. While as well tracking the history of progress made by the team, such as recording team meetings, keeping track of tasks being assigned. This team member would also need to provide feedback to all team members on the work they are doing, areas they would need to improve on in their work and areas that are well done, but if needs be offer that help to fellow team members if they are struggling with a certain criterion in the project.  </li>
                      <li> Project Lead User Interface Designer/Developer: A lead user interface/designer is needed to have the following skills. A history of working technology and application support analysing, with a bachelor’s degree in IT is necessary for this position. A basis of SQL and python would be a skill highly recommended.

                <h2> Group Reflections  </h2>
                  <h3> Individual Reflections </h3>
                    <h4> Andrew Mckenna </h4>
                      <p> The Beginners work well as a group, we seem to have very complementary skill sets and this allowed us to work on the parts of the assignment that we could each do our best in. We improved in every way since assignment 2, we used GitHub a bit more and had more frequent meetings to ensure that everyone was on track. What I learned from this experience is that how the group works together really makes a difference to the result. We made a solid plan for how we were going to work on this, and it shows in the quality of our website and report. Throughout this study period I have been surprised about how eager everyone in the group has been to contribute, my past experience with group work has included a lot more social loafing. It has been a pleasure to work with this group. </p>
                    <h4> Oliver Sloane  </h4>
                      <p> What I think went well with assignment 3. The communication was a lot better compared to assignment 2, work was completed before the due date, everyone knew what they needed to do, quality of work has improved, and group charisma is a lot higher for this assignment. I do not believe much more can be improved the only annoying thing was trying to find time for everyone to have the meeting, due to work commitments and different time zones but that was something we had learned to overcome. The one thing that surprised me was, how we were able to get everything done quite early, so we only needed to proofread and edit some trivial things. I had learned how to communicate more with the group, and how to bring more ideas to the table for discussion to see if it was anything we can use to progress the project.  </p>
                    <h4> Chris Anderson  </h4>
                      <p> What went well – Our group members are all fairly similar in work ethic and communication preferences. We didn’t have any trouble assigning tasks or contributing evenly throughout this assignment. Meetings were scheduled as required and everything ran smoothly all the way through. </p>
                      <p> What could be improved – Personally I missed a meeting because I did not have a chance to check teams on the day. This was not detrimental to group progress as I was able to catch up via group recordings and message boards, however. </p>
                      <p> At least one thing that was surprising- I was surprised at how keen and helpful every group member was. In my experience there is at least one person who doesn’t contribute as much as everyone else or is absent for most of the time, this was not the case. </p>
                      <p> At least one thing that you have learned about groups- I’ve learned that group work is not something to be dreaded as there are a lot of likeminded people out there who have a lot to add in a group work environment.  </p>
                    <h4> Valentin Parail   </h4>
                      <p> The group worked well together. Everyone worked to their individual strengths, and this made the assignment go smoothly. All group members worked effectively as a team and helped each other to complete the project.  </p>
                      <p>  While I was confident in my ability to organize and conduct these meetings, I did not anticipate full participation and the productive outcomes we achieved every time. </p>
                      <p> I believe working within this group was straightforward and went a lot smoother than assignment We work much more to our strengths and reassigned tasks as we believed would be best. We also started work on the assignment far earlier this time than last. Again, Covid-19 restrictions did add additional stress and pressure throughout the assignment period. </p>
                      <p> As we used Teams to collaborate, most of the work uploaded to GitHub is not 100% accurate. The only parts which are accurate in GitHub are those relating to the website. We worked together to develop the website although we worked individually to prepare the content for it, which we shared amongst the team using MS Teams. All the drafts, designs and initial questions had all been pre-done on Teams before we even looked at adding them on GitHub. As a group we found Teams far more reliable and easier to use overall than GitHub. </p>
                    <h4> Marc Winbank  </h4>
                      <p> I have genuinely enjoyed working with the team Beginners members during A3. We all are quite similar in our demeanor, have been punctual with deadlines and attendance, and accepting of our responsibility to each other. Covid-19 posed some difficult periods for us all, particularly those who have been forced into lockdown for an extended period, however despite this being discussed frequently it did not seem to hinder us too much. </p>
                      <p> Following on from A2, which was a disappointing result for all, we were able to identify areas of improvement to avoid the difficulties that were previously experienced. We had earlier and more frequent meetings, which I believe were a significant contributor to a more positive outcome. At this point also, we have spent almost 10 weeks working together, which made communication and transparency easier to establish early in the timeframe. </p>
                      <p> Team beginners’ core method of group collaboration, division, and submission of collaborative work was with MS Teams, therefore I do not think GitHub comments are a true and accurate representation of combined effort for our group. </p>
                  <h3> Group Reflection:  </h3>
                      <p> -What went well: We all agree that the beginners work well as a group, our skills are varied and fill most of each other’s gaps. We found Valentin to be the lead in coding, Andrew did most of the design work, Oliver and Chris were able to help with content and consolidation, and Marc was the lead on the storyboard. Having the role identification section really sparked this idea of separating responsibilities for the team and we found this helpful, as there was not too many people trying to work on the same thing at once. We all collaborated with ideas and checked each other’s work, which made progress simple and efficient for the team. Helping each other as required to fulfill assigned responsibilities made for a positive team working environment. We held an appropriate amount of meetings and made progress a lot earlier than in A2, our team meetings were enhanced with better minute taking than A2 as there was clear allocation of tasks and we had a consistent point to look back on if we needed reminding. We also used GitHub a bit more in line with our A2 feedback although the documents were mainly updated on teams as the platform allows documents to be edited live by more than one member at once. We believe we all used our strengths to contribute evenly to this assignment and have enjoyed the entire process. This is due to our similar demeanour’s and ability to collaborate effectively to meet deadlines. </p>
                      <p> -What could be improved: An extra layer of communication would have been helpful like a WhatsApp group, this being accessible on our mobile phones could have made us more reachable at short notice, however this was not a detriment to team work or progress as the recording feature of teams made it easy for us to catch up on any missed information. Following on from A2, which was a disappointing result for all, we were able to identify areas of improvement to avoid the difficulties that were previously experienced. We had earlier and more frequent meetings, which I believe were a significant contributor to a more positive outcome. At this point also, we have spent almost 10 weeks working together, which made communication and transparency easier to establish early in the timeframe as we all came to know each other a little better which made it easier to reach out and plan according to each team members schedule </p>
                      <p> -At least one thing that was surprising: We were all surprised at how eager each team member was to get in and help. This has been demonstrated through our ease of communication and ability to work cohesively during a difficult time, with some team members being locked down and others not due to geographical separation. </p>
                      <p> - At least one thing that you have learned about groups: Group work can be fun and we have proven that with this group. We learned that Microsoft teams is a great collaborations tool, particularly for holding team meeting and syncing our tasks. We used the calendar and Valentin sent out email invites so we were all aware and ready for each meeting (most of the time). Teams is also perfect for uploading and group editing our documents and artifacts. GitHub is useful for code development but the majority of organising and the body of the report was done on teams. </p>
