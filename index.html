                        						<p>The results of my personal PANAS test, are: Positive affect: 30 Negative affect: 27 The PANAS test, or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, measures, as the extended name suggests, the susceptibility of positive and negative affect toward personality traits, i.e., moods and emotions. More specifically regarding the scale, ‘positive affect’ refers to the individual’s tendency to experience positive emotions, a more positive manner of interaction and engagement with others and with personal obstacles and challenges. On the other hand, ‘negative affect’ scales traits of a more negative or unpleasurable nature, perspectives of negative inclination towards things such as connections and surroundings. For each dimension of the PANAS scale, both positive and negative, the resulting score falls between 10 and 50. The scale of score indicates one’s general susceptibility of negative and positive affect, whereby in terms of positive affect, a score of <25 is considered low positive affect, 26-35 is moderate and >36 is high. As for negative affect, a score of <10 is considered low negative affect, 11-20 moderate, and >21 is high.</p>

                            <h2> Group Processes: </h2>
                              <article> The Beginners worked cohesively as a team for assignment 2. Each member was punctual when Teams meetings were scheduled, delegation of responsibility was equal throughout the 5 members, and each brought unique strengths and contribution to the assignment. However, there were items which were identified for improvement in A3, as summarised below:  </article>
                              <ul>
                                <li> Minutes were not effectively captured during MS Teams meetings. Upon reflection of a comment or delegation of work within our Teams meetings, it was difficult to access concise information without watching the recording again. This will be improved for A3 through established templates and assignment of minute taking responsibility.  </li>
                                <li> Individual files added to Teams were not effectively labelled, therefore when reverting to a section for collaborative work or consolidation into the master document, identifying the correct file was difficult. Standardised nomenclature for file names was established for A3.  </li>
                                <li> The initial breakdown of tasks was performed in a way that caused an entire section to be missed. Essentially, each A2 section was identified, and a discussion regarding responsibility and approach would stem from that initial section in Teams chat. However, with section chats and new chat topics developing, the Industry Data section became buried as discussions progressed. The Beginners team assumed all requirements were covered without vigilantly aligning the rubric or assignment summary with our report. The method of identifying requirements and responsibilities is revised for A3.  </li>

                              </ul>
